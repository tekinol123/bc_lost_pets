# Welcome to my Project
### TLDR
##### I will be using pythons requests and bs4 libraries to scrape the SPCA's lost pets website in British Columbia, Canada. After extracting and cleaning the data using pandas, I will create a data pipeline to have the data fetched on a regular basis to a SQL server in Microsoft Azure. Once the data pipeline is made, I will create a dashboard in PowerBI to display my findings about the distributions of where the pets are lost and what species are being lost.

### Inspiration for project
##### My girlfriend is from British Columbia, Canada. Not too long ago, she lost her favorite cat names Cheeto in her hometown. She spend months posting in Facebook groups and checking found pet boards and websites, like the SPCA site, checking to see if Cheeto had been found. Being in California, I wanted to do more other than hope and pray that Cheeto would be found. I used my python skills to send a request to the SPCA website everyday at 9 a.m and send her a message on Discord with all the found cats in her area. This is where I began to wonder, I wonder how many people lose their pets and I wondered which species of animal is most likely to be lost, eventually leading me to think of this project idea. Eventually, Cheeto was found which was a huge relief, but I still wanted to know how many people this has happened to, which led me to creating this project and applying my Data Engineering skills to something personally valuable and interesting to me.
